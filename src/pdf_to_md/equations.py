"""Detection of mathematical content (Tier A: detect and quarantine).

A PDF stores an equation as positioned glyphs, not as an expression, so
there is no faithful plain-text form of it.  Rather than let a garbled
equation flow into a paragraph and read as prose, a display equation is
recognised and emitted as its own labelled block: the glyph run is
preserved verbatim and marked as unreliable, so a reader (or an agent)
can see what it is instead of quietly trusting it.

Two independent signals, both deterministic:

  * **font** -- TeX and journal math is set in dedicated fonts (Computer
    Modern's CMMI/CMSY/CMEX, MathTime, STIX/XITS Math, Symbol, ...).
  * **glyphs** -- characters from the Unicode mathematical blocks, plus
    Greek letters and the common operators.

Reconstructing the expression itself (fractions from rule geometry,
scripts from baseline offsets) is a separate, much larger job; this
module deliberately stops at "this is maths, and here it is verbatim".
